   		<h3>Basic Gameplay and Mechanics:</h3>
	
		<p>	
		Fantegio is based on the popular board game stratego. 
		Players take turns controlling 14 units with the goal of capturing the 
		other players Important Thing by moving a unit onto it. The caveat is that you 
		are unable to see any more than the location of the opponents' units. 
		</p>

		<h3>Set-up:</h3>
		<p>
		Each player starts with 14 units and gets to choose where those units start within their specified start zone.
		Then one of the players is randomly selected to go first. In the central part of the board there are three boulders that serve as immobile obstacles. 
		They cannot be moved onto. 
		<br>Beginning units are: 
		<br>1 of each - Assassin, Mystic, The Important Thing, Archer, Captain, Commander
		<br>2 of each - Trap, Engineer, Rider, Soldier
		</p>

		<h3>Turns:</h3>
		<p>
		Each turn a player can move one unit one space (Some unit specific exceptions apply). 
		Moving a unit onto another unit initiates combat. 
		</p>

		<h3>Combat:</h3>
		<p>
		Combat works by moving a unit into an enemy unit, akin to chess. 
		At this point both the units are revealed and the unit with the higher strength wins. 
		The unit with lower strength is permanently removed. If there is a tie both units are destroyed. 
		There are some unit specific exceptions to how combat works that are described in the units section.
