   		<h3>Basic Gameplay and Mechanics:</h3>
	
		<p>	
		Fantegio&#39;s core mechanic is the same as the popular board game stratego. 
		Players take turns controlling 14 fantasy themed units with the goal of capturing 
		the other players Important Thing by moving a unit onto it. The caveat is that under 
		most conditions the player can see the locations of the opponents units, but not the units themselves.
		</p>

		<h3>Set-up:</h3>
		<p>
		Each player starts with 14 units and gets to choose where those units start within their specified start zone. 			Then one of the players is randomly selected to go first. 
		<br>Beginning units are: 
		<br>1 of each - Assassin, Mystic, The Important Thing, Archer, Captain, Commander
		<br>2 of each - Trap, Engineer, Rider, Soldier
		</p>

		<h3>Turn:</h3>
		<p>
		Each turn a player can move one unit one space (Some unit specific exceptions apply). 
		Moving a unit onto another unit initiates combat. 
		</p>

		<h3>Combat:</h3>
		<p>
		Combat works by moving a unit into an enemy unit, akin to chess. 
		At this point both the units are revealed and the unit with the higher strength wins. 
		The unit with lower strength is permanently removed. If there is a tie both units are destroyed. 
		There are some unit specific exceptions to how combat works that are described in the units section.
